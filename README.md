<h1>My project Web Site!</h1>
<h2> Homes From Ellis</h2>

**Notes:**
* SVG Animations are not supported in IE10 and up.
* Login Info on "tenant-services" page: Username = "admin" & Password = "1234"

**Completed Requirements:**
* Git Hub: At least 5 commits 
* Create and populate a JavaScript array with one or more values and display the contents of some or all of the array on your page: Used JavaScript to populate images onto "Hull St" page.
* Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code: **My Hamburger Menu shows and hides nav menu.**
* Create your own original CSS animation. For example, create a loading spinner or menu animation: **My Homepage includes an SVG animation.. The SVG was created in Adobe Illustrator and I animated to draw when the page loads.**
* Create a form... and then use that information on your page somehow. For example, display it back to the user on button click, or change a setting on the page based on a section. Having a form that does nothing on clicking Submit or that just refreshes the page is not enough - you must capture the value(s) of the form and use it somehow. **The form on the "Tenant Services" page loads a new page when correct credentials are input... if the credentials are incorrect, an alert displays.**


**Media Queries:**
* Mobile First: Starts with a hamburger menu for nav and column layout
* At 760px layout adjusts for wider devices, such as a tablet and content rearranges for a better user experience. i.e. Hamburger menu changes to a menu bar across the top left and body content shifts to row layout.
* At 1024px layout adjusts for bigger screens. i.e. On homepage, SVG drops to the bottom of the page and the main content increases in size and is presented first.
