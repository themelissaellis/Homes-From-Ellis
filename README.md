**Notes:**
* SVG Animations are not supported in IE10 and up.
* Login Info on "tenant-services" page: Username = "admin" & Password = "1234"

**Completed Requirements:**
* Git Hub: At least 5 commits 
* Create and populate a JavaScript array with one or more values and display the contents of some or all of the array on your page: Used JavaScript to populate images onto "Hull St" page.
* Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code: Hamburger Menu shows and hides nav menu.
* Create your own original CSS animation. For example, create a loading spinner or menu animation: Homepage includes an SVG animation.. the SVG was created in Adobe Illustrator and I animated to draw when the page loads.


**Media Queries:**
* Mobile First: Starts with a hamburger menu for nav and column layout
* At 760px layout adjusts for wider devices, such as a tablet and content rearranges for a better user experience. i.e. Hamburger menu changes to a menu bar across the top left and body content shifts to row layout.
* At 1024px layout adjusts for bigger screens. i.e. On homepage, SVG drops to the bottom of the page and the main content increases in size and is presented first.
